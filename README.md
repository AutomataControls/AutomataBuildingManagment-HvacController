## Control Logic and Decision Making

The core of the Automata Building Automation Controller is its advanced control logic, which uses real-time data and predictive models to optimize building systems.

### Core Algorithms

1. **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**: Predicts future environmental changes and optimizes system performance across HVAC, lighting, and security.
2. **Adaptive PID Control**: Adjusts dynamically to manage temperature, humidity, lighting, and more based on real-time conditions.
3. **Machine Learning-Based Prediction**: Analyzes historical data to predict occupancy patterns and adjust systems accordingly.

### Decision-Making Workflow

1. **Data Aggregation**: Sensor data is normalized and aggregated from all building systems.
2. **Setpoint Optimization**: MPC calculates optimal setpoints for temperature, lighting, and security for the next several hours.
3. **Control Execution**: PID controllers adjust system components based on real-time conditions.
4. **Feedback Loop**: The system continuously learns from performance data to improve control logic.
